### Project 3: Employee Database Management using SQL

### Objective: Design and manage an employee database using SQL, demonstrating proficiency in querying and manipulating data.

### Tasks:

1. Create a database schema for employee data (tables: Employees, Departments, Salaries).
2. Insert sample data into each table.
3. Write queries to:
    - Retrieve employee information (filtering, sorting, grouping).
    - Calculate aggregate values (e.g., average salary by department).
    - Update employee records.
    - Delete inactive employees.
4. Implement SQL joins to combine employee and department data.
5. Create views for simplified data access.

### Deliverables:
